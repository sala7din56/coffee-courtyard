  ⎿  Read instractions.md (109 lines)

● I'll help you create the Coffee CourtYard website based on the instructions. Let me start by exploring the design source folder and then building the complete project.

● Bash(ls stitch_home_page)
  ⎿  stitch_home_page

● Search(pattern: "stitch_home_page/**/*")
  ⎿  Found 10 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(stitch_home_page\stitch_home_page\home_page\code.html)
  ⎿  Read 225 lines

  ⎿  Read 245 lines

● Read(stitch_home_page\stitch_home_page\location_&_contact\code.html)
  ⎿  Read 173 lines

● Perfect! I've analyzed the design source files. Now I'll create the complete Coffee CourtYard website with all the components specified in the instructions.

      */
     /**

● Now let me create the main frontend index page:

● Write(coffee_courtyard\public\index.php)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\public\index.php       
     <?php
     /**

      */
     require_once '../includes/config.php';
     require_once '../includes/db.php';
     require_once '../includes/functions.php';

● Now let me create the CSS and JS files, then move on to the admin system:

● Write(coffee_courtyard\public\css\styles.css)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\public\css\styles.css 
     /**
      * Custom Styles for Coffee CourtYard

     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
         // Smooth scrolling for anchor links
         const smoothScrollLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#"]');

● Now let me create the admin login and dashboard system:

  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\admin\login.php
     <?php
     /**

     require_once '../includes/config.php';
     require_once '../includes/functions.php';
     // Check if user is logged in

  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\admin\dashboard.php
     <?php
     /**

      */
     require_once 'auth_check.php';
     require_once '../includes/db.php';
     $db = new Database();

● Let me create the admin CSS file and then the menu items CRUD pages:

● Write(coffee_courtyard\admin\css\admin.css)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\admin\css\admin.css
     /**
      * Admin Dashboard Styles

      */
     /* Custom scrollbar for sidebar */
     aside::-webkit-scrollbar {
         width: 6px;
     }

● Now let me create the menu items CRUD page which is the most complex admin functionality. Due to length, I'll break this into view and action handling:

● Write(coffee_courtyard\admin\menu_items.php)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\admin\menu_items.php
     <?php
     /**

     require_once 'auth_check.php';
     require_once '../includes/db.php';

      * Edit homepage sections
      */
     require_once 'auth_check.php';
     require_once '../includes/db.php';

● Perfect! Now let me create the comprehensive setup documentation:

● Write(coffee_courtyard\README.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to coffee_courtyard\README.md

> run the project 

● I'll help you run the Coffee CourtYard project! Let me start XAMPP and set everything up.

● Bash(tasklist | findstr "httpd.exe mysql")
  ⎿  httpd.exe                    16796 Console                    1     24,192 K
     httpd.exe                    14400 Console                    1     29,328 K

● Good! Apache is running. Now let me check if MySQL is running:

● Bash(tasklist | findstr "mysqld")
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1

● MySQL is not running. Let me check the XAMPP installation path and start the services:

● Bash(dir "C:\xampp" 2>nul && echo XAMPP found at C:\xampp || echo XAMPP not found)
  ⎿  XAMPP not found

● XAMPP is not installed yet. Let me check if we can use PHP's built-in server as an alternative to get the project running quickly:

● Bash(where php)
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 1
     INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s).

● I see that XAMPP is not installed on your system yet. Let me provide you with clear instructions to get the project running:

  🚀 To Run the Coffee CourtYard Project:

  Option 1: Full Setup with XAMPP (Recommended)

  Step 1: Download & Install XAMPP
  1. Go to: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
  2. Download XAMPP for Windows (includes Apache, MySQL, PHP)
  3. Install it (default location: C:\xampp)

  Step 2: Configure Apache for Port 8080
  1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
  2. Click "Config" next to Apache → Select "httpd.conf"
  3. Find line Listen 80 → Change to Listen 8080
  4. Find line ServerName localhost:80 → Change to ServerName localhost:8080
  5. Save and close

  Step 3: Copy Project Files

● Bash(if not exist "C:\xampp\htdocs\" mkdir "C:\xampp\htdocs\")
  ⎿  Error: Exit code 2
     /usr/bin/bash: eval: line 2: syntax error: unexpected end of file

● Let me provide you with the complete setup instructions:

     Replace with: ServerName localhost:8080
  4. Save file

  3. Copy Project Files

  Copy the coffee_courtyard folder to:

  Your current project is at:
  C:\Users\Noah\OneDrive\Desktop\CoffeeCourtyard\coffee_courtyard

  4. Start Services

  1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
  2. Click "Start" for Apache
  3. Click "Start" for MySQL
  4. Both should show green "Running" status

  ⚡ Quick Alternative (If you want to test without full setup)

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create a simple test HTML version that doesn't require database?
  2. Guide you through installing XAMPP step by step?
  3. Wait for you to install XAMPP and then help you set it up?

  Let me know which option you prefer, and I'll help you get the website running! 🚀
